 *  This class allows you to simply add triangles as if this class were a 
 *  container. The AddTriangle() function searches the current list of triangles
 *  and determines if the vertex/normal/texcoord is a duplicate. If so, it addes
 *  an entry to the index array instead of the list of vertices.
 *  When finished, call EndMesh() to free up extra unneeded memory that is reserved
 *  as workspace when you call BeginMesh().
 *
 *  This class can easily be extended to contain other vertex attributes, and to 
 *  save itself and load itself from disk (thus forming the beginnings of a custom
 *  model file format).
