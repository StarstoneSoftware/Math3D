# Math3D
A simple vector and matrix library containing functions useful for 3D graphics programming.
This library started out life in an earlier edition of my book the OpenGL SuperBible. I have 
found it to be tremendously useful in almost every 3D project I have undertaken since then,
and it's quite useful in other fields as well, such as for astronomical coordinate transformations.
I hope others will find it useful here, and I will update it from time to time as I make updates, 
and I welcome updates of useful functionaliyt from the open source community.'
